# cognitive_load_estimation

Cognitive load estimation has been studied across
domains for the last three decades. It is considered an essential
parameter for understanding human performance and cognition.
Most popular methods for Cognitive workload estimation are
eye-tracking, Electroencephalography, and wearable sensors. All
three methods have slight advantages and disadvantages regarding accuracy and ease of use. In this paper, an overview of
these various methodologies has been discussed. An open-source
EEG dataset is considered for experimenting. p-value metrics is
used for feature selection. 10-fold cross validation is implemented
over the dataset. The highest classification accuracy of 97.47% is
achieved by using support-vector machine(radial basis function).
